# frame (mini-app)

The **frame** packages are used to create a mini-app that can be embedded in a web page. They implement a micro-frontend pattern that facilitates [run-time integration via iframes](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html#Run-timeIntegrationViaIframes).

There are 2 packages:

- `@eventpop-oss/frame-host` - The host package is for the application that will embed the mini-app.
- `@eventpop-oss/frame-guest` - The guest package is for the mini-app that will be embedded. Mini-apps are built with React.

A communication channel between the host and the guest is establish using the [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API.

They work together to:

- Auto-resize the iframe to fit the content.
- Provide an RPC mechanism to call functions in the guest from the host and vice versa (loosely based on [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)).
- Provide joint history management between the host and the guest.

## Creating a mini-app

Implement a mini-app using React and the `@eventpop-oss/frame-guest` package.

### Routing

It features a routing system based on [React Router 6.4](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

Some [hacks](https://github.com/eventpop/frame/blob/main/packages/guest/src/packlets/guest/MiniAppRouter.tsx) are added to allow it to synchronize the history with the parent window.

- Use **`createMiniApp`** to define a mini-app’s routes [(see example)](https://github.com/eventpop/frame/blob/main/packages/guest/src/DemoMiniApp.tsx).

  - The `routes` property is [the routes array that you would pass to React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router).

- Render a **`<MiniAppPage />`** to mount it to the DOM. [(see example)](https://github.com/eventpop/frame/blob/main/packages/guest/src/main.tsx)

- Use **`<MiniAppLink />`** to link to other routes in the mini-app.

  - It is based on [React Router’s `<Link />`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link).

- Use **`useMiniAppNavigate`** to programmatically navigate to other routes in the mini-app.

  - It is based on [React Router’s `useNavigate`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate).

- Use **`useMiniAppSearchParams`** to access (read and write) the search params of the current route.

  - It is based on [React Router’s `useSearchParams`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-search-params).

### Advanced customization

[Use **`<MiniAppSettingsProvider />`** to customize the mini-app’s settings.](https://github.com/eventpop/frame/blob/main/packages/guest/src/packlets/guest/MiniAppSettings.tsx)

### Resize pausing

Sometimes the auto-resize feature needs to be temporarily disabled. For example, auto-resizing while a drag and drop interaction is in progress can cause it to be canceled. To resolve this problem:

- Create a ResizePauser using **`new ResizePauser()`**. You can put it in the module scope.

- When a drag and drop interaction starts, call **`resizePauser.pause()`**.

- When the drag and drop interaction ends, call **`resizePauser.unpause()`**.

## Embedding a mini-app

Use the `@eventpop-oss/frame-host` package to embed a mini-app.

- Create an `iframe` and use the [**`MiniAppIframeController`**](https://github.com/eventpop/frame/blob/main/packages/host/src/packlets/host/MiniAppIframeController.ts) class to embed a mini-app into that iframe.

- Call `.dispose()` on the instance when you no longer need it.
