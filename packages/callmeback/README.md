# callmeback

üöß This project is under construction. It is not yet ready for use. üöß

Serverless-friendly background processing library. This library lets you enqueue HTTP requests to be processed in the background with adapters for:

- [Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html)
- [Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks)
- In-process adapter (for local development and testing)

Due to differences in the way each service works, this library makes the following trade-off:

- The request method is always POST.
- The request body is always JSON-encoded. Some providers doesn‚Äôt allow setting request headers, so your endpoint should be configured to always decode JSON body, even if Content-Type is not `application/json`.
- Your service should be configured to send a 429 (Too Many Requests) when it is overloaded.
- The URL is fixed. On some services this must be preconfigured (e.g. [Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.subscribe.html)), while on other services it can be configured directly on the adapter (e.g. [Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-http-target-tasks)).
- Retry logic depends on the service. Amazon SNS has a [default retry policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.retry.html) but [it can be configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-delivery-retries.html#creating-delivery-policy) on a topic or subscription. On Google Cloud Tasks, a [RetryConfig](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.queues#RetryConfig) can be [configured](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/configuring-queues#retry) on a queue.
- Rate limiting (throttling) depends on the service. Amazon SNS lets you [configure a throttle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-delivery-retries.html#creating-delivery-policy) at the topic or subscription level. Google Cloud Tasks lets you [configure](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/configuring-queues#retry) [RateLimits](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.queues#ratelimits) on a queue.

## Configuring queues and running tests

By default, the tests will only run against the in-process adapter.

To run the tests against other adapters, there are some preparation steps.

1. Expose the `requestbin` service so that it‚Äôs publicly available.

   - If you are developing in Codespaces, you can go to the **Ports** tab, right click on the server‚Äôs **Local Address** &rarr; **Port Visibility** &rarr; **Public**.
   - You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Cloudflare Quick Tunnel](https://blog.cloudflare.com/quick-tunnels-anytime-anywhere/) to expose the service.

   Then set the environment variable `REQUESTBIN_URL` to the URL of the `requestbin` service **without the trailing slash**, for example:

   ```sh
   export REQUESTBIN_URL=https://dtinth-verbose-computing-machine-rr4g7rgqv2jgj-35124.preview.app.github.dev
   ```

2. Set up the credentials for the other adapters.

   - Check out the below sections for more details.

## Usage with Amazon SNS

About [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/):

- You need to [pre-configure the URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.subscribe.html) when creating the subscription.
- Once the subscription is created, you must [confirm the subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.confirm.html). Amazon SNS will send a request to the URL you configured. That request body will contain a `SubscribeURL` parameter. You must make a `GET` request to that URL to confirm the subscription. You can make your endpoint do that automatically, or you can take the URL and visit it manually in your browser.
- I am not sure whether SNS respects the `Retry-After` response header or not. If someone was able to test this, please let us know and update the documentation.
- Amazon SNS provides [metrics viewable in CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html) out-of-the-box. However, [individual message delivery status logging must be configured and viewed in CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-topic-attributes.html). It lets you adjust the sampling rate to save costs.

Creating an adapter:

```ts
import { SNS } from '@aws-sdk/client-sns'

const adapter = new AmazonSNSAdapter({
  topicArn: process.env.CALLMEBACK_SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
  sns: new SNS({}),
})
```

Expected environment variables:

```sh
CALLMEBACK_SNS_TOPIC_ARN=

# When providing credentials to the SDK via environment variables.
# Note that there may be better ways to provide credentials to the SDK
# depending on your environment and use case.
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-iam.html
AWS_REGION=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Common errors:

- **Error: Region is missing**
  - May be fixed by setting the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.
- **CredentialsProviderError: Could not load credentials from any providers**
  - May be fixed by [providing the credentials to the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).
- **AuthorizationErrorException: User: ‚Ä¶ is not authorized to perform: SNS:Publish on resource: ‚Ä¶ because no identity-based policy allows the SNS:Publish action**
  - May be fixed by granting the user permission to publish to the topic.
- **InvalidParameterException: Invalid parameter: TopicArn or TargetArn Reason: no value for required parameter**
  - May be fixed by correctly configuring the `topicArn` (i.e. the `CALLMEBACK_SNS_TOPIC_ARN` environment variable).
- **NotFoundException: Topic does not exist**
  - May be fixed by creating the topic (and making sure the topic ARN is correctly configured).

## Usage with Google Cloud Tasks

About [Google Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/):

- Allows the URL to be configured on a per-task basis.
- The URL does not need to be confirmed.
- [Respects the `Retry-After` response header, and retries with a higher backoff rate if 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable) is returned.](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.queues.tasks#httprequest)
- Provides a dashboard for viewing metrics and ongoing task statuses.
- [Logging can be turned on for individual tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/logging), but it is not enabled by default, as it may generate a large number of logs and can increase costs. Once enabled, it can be viewed in the [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) dashboard. Note that this is an all-or-nothing setting (no sampling).

Creating an adapter:

```ts
import { CloudTasksClient } from '@google-cloud/tasks'

const adapter = new GoogleCloudTasksAdapter({
  client: new CloudTasksClient(),
  queuePath: process.env.CALLMEBACK_CLOUD_TASK_QUEUE,
  url: 'https://.../',
})
```

Expected environment variables:

```sh
# PROJECT_ID is the ID of the Google Cloud project, found on the Google Cloud Console dashboard.
# LOCATION_ID is the ID of the location where the queue is located, e.g. "us-central1".
# QUEUE_ID is the ID of the queue, e.g. "callmeback".
CALLMEBACK_CLOUD_TASK_QUEUE=projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID

# When providing service account credentials to the SDK via environment variables.
# Note that there may be better ways to provide credentials to the SDK
# depending on your environment and use case.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=
```

Common errors:

- **Error: Could not load the default credentials.**
  - May be fixed by [providing the credentials to the SDK](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
- **Error: 3 INVALID_ARGUMENT: Invalid resource field value in the request.**
  - May be fixed by correctly configuring the `queuePath` (i.e. the `CALLMEBACK_CLOUD_TASK_QUEUE` environment variable) and making sure the `url` is valid.
- **Error: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED: The principal (user or service account) lacks IAM permission "cloudtasks.tasks.create" for the resource "projects/‚Ä¶/locations/‚Ä¶/queues/‚Ä¶" (or the resource may not exist).**
  - May be fixed by making sure the queue exists, the `queuePath` is correctly configured, permission to create tasks in the queue is granted to the user or service account (by using the ‚ÄúCloud Tasks Enqueuer‚Äù role).
